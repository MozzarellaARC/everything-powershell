## *How does it work?*
The code parse strings from data that is created when you open up an application, so if you have an application that is not yet open the first time or an app that is being used without instalation this script may not work properly.

- suitable for user that hates finding app through icons
- very save and optimized, uses cache method to save memory for consecutive run
- easy syntax for example to open Google Chrome you can just type:
```open chrome```


*Before installing it might not work on Windows 10 and Powershell bellow version 7*
